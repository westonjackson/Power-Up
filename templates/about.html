<p></p>



<p> Our group visited Jerome Avenue in the Bronx where we interviewed a young woman named Jenni at the corner of University and Burnside Avenue. Jenni is a college student at Bronx Community College who works at a local daycare afterschool. Not only did Jenni share her fear of walking alone in the neighborhood (especially when it gets dark), but she also explained to us how scary it is to be a woman in this area alone. Jenni noticed a lot of prevalent drug activity, street violence, and harassment when she was out and about in Jerome. We could all tell through the tone of her voice and the way she explained the situation to us that she knew women who have experienced circumstances like this one. The intended users of our app and safety glasses combination will be these women that reside in the Jerome Avenue community, who we aspire to create a safe environment for. </p>

<p> Our app includes the ability to report to the city and other users you have friended on the app. This is manifested through functinalities like a heat map, links to city authorities, crime data, and other useful information. There is a consistent feeling of negativity and fear that we have seen sparked in the women of Jerome Avenue, that within a community of single mothers, college women, elderly, and numerous other people, we intend to try and reduce the amount of crime that goes unreported and the number of women feeling threatened on Jerome Ave. </p>
